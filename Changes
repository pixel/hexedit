september 2005:
	- version 1.2.12
	- colored (fruit salad) display built by default (if use_default_colors available), 
	  available through option --color (based on a patch from Yuri D'Elia)

september 2005:
	- version 1.2.11
	- add --enable-colors to build and have a colored (fruit salad) display 
	- allow entering goto "position" and "sector" in hexadecimal or not
	- when prompting, propose previously entered value, and give ability to modify it
	- fix setting mark after scrolling
	- some cleanup

may 2004:
	- version 1.2.10
	- handle getnstr() not defined (needed for SGI IRIX 6.5.22)

april 2004:
	- version 1.2.9 (brown paper bag version)
	- fix searching larger than 3 characters long strings

january 2004:
	- version 1.2.8
	- replace the unsafe getstr() with getnstr() (thanks to Richard Chadderton)

august 2003:
	- version 1.2.7
	- check the presence of <sys/mount.h> before including it
	- fix build on Digital UNIX 4.0f (remove -Wall)
	- use the full width of the terminal (the trick is to stop relying on
	printing "\n", but using move() instead)
	- fix displaying the offsets at beginning of each line on big endian
	boxes (thanks to Martin Schaffner)

june 2003:
	- version 1.2.6
	- fix core dump when searching backward (thanks to Jean Delvare)
          (the culprit is memrmem, but also fixing provided memrchr)

june 2003:
	- version 1.2.5
	- fix build on Solaris (which doesn't have BLKGETSIZE and all compilers don't have -W)

march 2003:
	- version 1.2.4
	- use BLKGETSIZE to try to get the size of a device
	- do not die horribly when accessing after the end
	- fix provided memrchr() (thanks to Yue Luo)
	- fix displaying after searching >32bit files (thanks to Paul Mattal)

june 2002:
	- version 1.2.3
	- add some KEY_HOME KEY_END (^[[7~ and ^[[8~)
	- fix for HAVE_MEMMEM
	- fix my memrchr not behaving the same as libc's
	- fix the use of memrchr to behave as libc's
	- use "(void)" in prototype of functions having no parameters
	- call "raw()" when help() is over

october 2001:
	- version 1.2.2
	- yet again some s/int/INT/ (mainly in the "edited" list manipulation)

june 2001:
	- version 1.2.1
	- replace llseek with lseek + use of _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
	- memrchr&memmem now exists in some glibc's, so define it only if not provided
	- cleanup basename declaration
	- various cleanup in configure.in, now using autoheader
	- a few bug fixes

april 99: 
	- version 1.1.1
	- replaced lots of int by INT which 64bits
	- replaced lseek by llseek (!! portability=linux :( !!)

11 january 99: (:-<>, it's been a long time)

	- added many shortcuts so that F1..F12 and some others works on more
	terms (xterm, rxvt, sgi's winterm...)
	- removed the scanw that's badly handled on sgi (replaced by getstr +
	sscanf)

24 septembre 98: now displays the reached offset while searching

10 september 98: hexedit 1.0.0 release

08 september 98: Oliver Kiddle's <opk@thoth.u-net.com> changes:
	- changed code where a function that returns a void was returning the
          result of another function. This avoids errors in stricter compilers
	- used an if where ?: was being used to the left of an assignment
	- created Makefile.in and configure.in to replace Makefile
        - added alternative strdup, strerror and memcmp for lacking systems 

26 august 98: hexedit 0.9.5 release

26 august 98: removed the total file size in modeline for devices

19 august 98: Evin Robertson's changes:
	- split hexedit.c into display.c, file.c, hexedit.c, hexedit.h,
	  interact.c, mark.c, misc.c, page.c, search.c
	- Makefile changes - now defaults to installing in /usr/local/bin
	- scrolls one line at a time (but not in sector mode)
	- allow appending to the file
	- errors during writing are now non-fatal
	- show total file size in modeline (not really correct for devices)
	- gives better error messages when functions return -1
	- added newlines to the end of fatal error messages
	- changed sizeof(bufferAttr) to sizeof(*bufferAttr)
	- grammatical corrections to the man page
	- removed dashes so the display is 16 bytes wide on an 80 column
	  screen
	- backspace now moves back an entire byte in hex mode (I thought the
	  previous behavior was inconsistent; it moved the cursor one
	  nybble, but undid an entire byte)
	- refuse to open directories
	- disallow using return to go past the end of the file
	- added truncating ability (M-T)

07 august 98: ability to fill the selection with a string

06 august 98: forgot to mark all the things while doing them. Here is a list of
	what's been added:

	- make the display start at the current cursor position
	- go to a sector when in --sector mode
	- added a modeline
	- ability to open another file. Nice for copy&paste between files
	- you're no more forced to save the file per page. This means the
	cut&paste can now always be undone. It's much simplier that way (idea
	from Evin C Robertson, thanks)
	- the backspace acts as a small undo of the previous character. It's
	nice when typing (another idea from Evin C Robertson)
	- the modified-unmodified bytes are not shown in bold (eg: you replace
	'a' by 'a')

26 july 98: added a TODO file

26 july 98: added save copied region in a file

26 july 98: added search backward

25 july 98: added copy&paste functions

25 july 98: you can now select a part of the buffer

21 july 98: modified bytes are shown in bold.

21 july 98: corrected a bug, when you call function goto_char and the file is
	modified, you're now asked if you want to save (before that the changes
	were lost). You're only asked if the goto_char gets you to a different
	page of the file.

21 july 98: replace the searchInBuffer function by memmem. Then replaced memmem
	by mymemmem to counter the libc bug. All this permits a good speedup
	when searching.

21 july 98: removed the bug in the goto_char function. Now giving an empty
	string leaves the cursor unmoved. A small bug remains if you give an
	invalid hexadecimal string starting legally. The scanw(3ncurses)
	function returns a number corresponding at the legal beginning substring
	(eg: 1z2 becomes 1).

21 july 98: added an install entry in the Makefile (the one Robert Woodcock
	<rcw@oz.net> made for the debian package, thanks Robert Woodcock).

21 july 98: creation of the Changes file
