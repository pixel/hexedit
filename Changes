september 2018:
	- Now writes before of filename, file position and file size at status line because if filename is long,
	  user cannot view file position and file size
	- fix clean filename at end of line after load with F3 when filename reach end of line
	- fix input long filename (longer than 136 chars) with F3 for next time. It repeats long filename until bottom screen and hangs.
	  Only works CTRL+C. I think that is a bug in ncurses. My work around is to print the long filename (if is longer than 136 chars),
	  but you can't edit it. You can load it pressing the RETURN key
	- fix copy & paste bytes unchanged between bytes changed. Paste leave bytes unchanged to 00

	- colored (fruit salad) display built by default (if use_default_colors available), 
	  available through option --color (based on a patch from Yuri D'Elia)

september 2005:
	- version 1.2.11

	boxes (thanks to Martin Schaffner)

june 2003:
	- version 1.2.6

          (the culprit is memrmem, but also fixing provided memrchr)

june 2003:
	- version 1.2.5
	- fix build on Solaris (which doesn't have BLKGETSIZE and all compilers don't have -W)

march 2003:
	- version 1.2.4
	- use BLKGETSIZE to try to get the size of a device
	- do not die horribly when accessing after the end
	- fix provided memrchr() (thanks to Yue Luo)
	- fix displaying after searching >32bit files (thanks to Paul Mattal)

june 2002:
	- version 1.2.3

october 2001:
	- version 1.2.2
	- yet again some s/int/INT/ (mainly in the "edited" list manipulation)

	- version 1.2.1
	- replace llseek with lseek + use of _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
	- memrchr&memmem now exists in some glibc's, so define it only if not provided
	- cleanup basename declaration
	- various cleanup in configure.in, now using autoheader
	- a few bug fixes

april 99: 
	- version 1.1.1
	- replaced lots of int by INT which 64bits
	- replaced lseek by llseek (!! portability=linux :( !!)

11 january 99: (:-<>, it's been a long time)

	- added many shortcuts so that F1..F12 and some others works on more
	terms (xterm, rxvt, sgi's winterm...)
	- removed the scanw that's badly handled on sgi (replaced by getstr +
	sscanf)

24 septembre 98: now displays the reached offset while searching

10 september 98: hexedit 1.0.0 release

08 september 98: Oliver Kiddle's <opk@thoth.u-net.com> changes:
	- changed code where a function that returns a void was returning the
          result of another function. This avoids errors in stricter compilers
	- used an if where ?: was being used to the left of an assignment
	- created Makefile.in and configure.in to replace Makefile
        - added alternative strdup, strerror and memcmp for lacking systems 

26 august 98: hexedit 0.9.5 release

26 august 98: removed the total file size in modeline for devices

19 august 98: Evin Robertson's changes:
	- split hexedit.c into display.c, file.c, hexedit.c, hexedit.h,
	  interact.c, mark.c, misc.c, page.c, search.c
	- Makefile changes - now defaults to installing in /usr/local/bin
	- scrolls one line at a time (but not in sector mode)
	- allow appending to the file
	- errors during writing are now non-fatal
	- show total file size in modeline (not really correct for devices)
	- gives better error messages when functions return -1
	- added newlines to the end of fatal error messages
	- changed sizeof(bufferAttr) to sizeof(*bufferAttr)
	- grammatical corrections to the man page
	- removed dashes so the display is 16 bytes wide on an 80 column
	  screen
	- backspace now moves back an entire byte in hex mode (I thought the
	  previous behavior was inconsistent; it moved the cursor one
	  nybble, but undid an entire byte)
	- refuse to open directories
	- disallow using return to go past the end of the file
	- added truncating ability (M-T)

07 august 98: ability to fill the selection with a string

06 august 98: forgot to mark all the things while doing them. Here is a list of
	what's been added:

	- make the display start at the current cursor position
	- go to a sector when in --sector mode
	- added a modeline
	- ability to open another file. Nice for copy&paste between files
	- you're no more forced to save the file per page. This means the
	cut&paste can now always be undone. It's much simplier that way (idea
	from Evin C Robertson, thanks)
	- the backspace acts as a small undo of the previous character. It's
	nice when typing (another idea from Evin C Robertson)
	- the modified-unmodified bytes are not shown in bold (eg: you replace
	'a' by 'a')

26 july 98: added a TODO file

26 july 98: added save copied region in a file

26 july 98: added search backward

25 july 98: added copy&paste functions

25 july 98: you can now select a part of the buffer

21 july 98: modified bytes are shown in bold.

21 july 98: corrected a bug, when you call function goto_char and the file is
	modified, you're now asked if you want to save (before that the changes
	were lost). You're only asked if the goto_char gets you to a different
	page of the file.

21 july 98: replace the searchInBuffer function by memmem. Then replaced memmem
	by mymemmem to counter the libc bug. All this permits a good speedup
	when searching.

21 july 98: removed the bug in the goto_char function. Now giving an empty
	string leaves the cursor unmoved. A small bug remains if you give an
	invalid hexadecimal string starting legally. The scanw(3ncurses)
	function returns a number corresponding at the legal beginning substring
	(eg: 1z2 becomes 1).

21 july 98: added an install entry in the Makefile (the one Robert Woodcock
	<rcw@oz.net> made for the debian package, thanks Robert Woodcock).

21 july 98: creation of the Changes file
