    - 1.7
    - Heavily refactored arg parsing to use a simple search-and-dispatch pattern
    - The argument order no longer matters. The last filename entered is the one used.
    - longopts can now take arguments in --key=value or --key value format
    - Added -c to --color
    - -h/--help is now a canon option
    - -- now disables opt parsing instead of merely exiting the arg parsing loop
    - updated man page to explain what -s/--sector does
    - made an effort to keep code style as similar to pixel's as possible (next line brace, 2-space indent)

april 2022
    - 1.6
    - configure script must error-out when (n)curses isn't found
    - Move SIGWINCH handling from handler to NCURSES
    - Make configure.ac compliant with autoconf >= 2.70
    - Check that malloc did not return NULL
    - Fix a possible memory leak in findFile()
    - Prevent division by zero on empty files.

	  available through option --color (based on a patch from Yuri D'Elia)

	- memrchr&memmem now exists in some glibc's, so define it only if not provided
	- cleanup basename declaration
	- various cleanup in configure.in, now using autoheader
	- a few bug fixes

april 99: 
	- version 1.1.1
	- replaced lots of int by INT which 64bits
	- replaced lseek by llseek (!! portability=linux :( !!)

11 january 99: (:-<>, it's been a long time)

	- added many shortcuts so that F1..F12 and some others works on more
	terms (xterm, rxvt, sgi's winterm...)
	- removed the scanw that's badly handled on sgi (replaced by getstr +
	sscanf)

24 septembre 98: now displays the reached offset while searching

10 september 98: hexedit 1.0.0 release

08 september 98: Oliver Kiddle's <opk@thoth.u-net.com> changes:
	- changed code where a function that returns a void was returning the
          result of another function. This avoids errors in stricter compilers
	- used an if where ?: was being used to the left of an assignment
	- created Makefile.in and configure.in to replace Makefile
        - added alternative strdup, strerror and memcmp for lacking systems 

26 august 98: hexedit 0.9.5 release

26 august 98: removed the total file size in modeline for devices

19 august 98: Evin Robertson's changes:
	- split hexedit.c into display.c, file.c, hexedit.c, hexedit.h,
	  interact.c, mark.c, misc.c, page.c, search.c
	- Makefile changes - now defaults to installing in /usr/local/bin
	- scrolls one line at a time (but not in sector mode)
	- allow appending to the file
	- errors during writing are now non-fatal
	- show total file size in modeline (not really correct for devices)
	- gives better error messages when functions return -1
	- added newlines to the end of fatal error messages
	- changed sizeof(bufferAttr) to sizeof(*bufferAttr)
	- grammatical corrections to the man page
	- removed dashes so the display is 16 bytes wide on an 80 column
	  screen
	- backspace now moves back an entire byte in hex mode (I thought the
	  previous behavior was inconsistent; it moved the cursor one
	  nybble, but undid an entire byte)
	- refuse to open directories
	- disallow using return to go past the end of the file
	- added truncating ability (M-T)

07 august 98: ability to fill the selection with a string

06 august 98: forgot to mark all the things while doing them. Here is a list of
	what's been added:

	- make the display start at the current cursor position
	- go to a sector when in --sector mode
	- added a modeline
	- ability to open another file. Nice for copy&paste between files
	- you're no more forced to save the file per page. This means the
	cut&paste can now always be undone. It's much simplier that way (idea
	from Evin C Robertson, thanks)
	- the backspace acts as a small undo of the previous character. It's
	nice when typing (another idea from Evin C Robertson)
	- the modified-unmodified bytes are not shown in bold (eg: you replace
	'a' by 'a')

26 july 98: added a TODO file

26 july 98: added save copied region in a file

26 july 98: added search backward

25 july 98: added copy&paste functions

25 july 98: you can now select a part of the buffer

21 july 98: modified bytes are shown in bold.

21 july 98: corrected a bug, when you call function goto_char and the file is
	modified, you're now asked if you want to save (before that the changes
	were lost). You're only asked if the goto_char gets you to a different
	page of the file.

21 july 98: replace the searchInBuffer function by memmem. Then replaced memmem
	by mymemmem to counter the libc bug. All this permits a good speedup
	when searching.

21 july 98: removed the bug in the goto_char function. Now giving an empty
	string leaves the cursor unmoved. A small bug remains if you give an
	invalid hexadecimal string starting legally. The scanw(3ncurses)
	function returns a number corresponding at the legal beginning substring
	(eg: 1z2 becomes 1).

21 july 98: added an install entry in the Makefile (the one Robert Woodcock
	<rcw@oz.net> made for the debian package, thanks Robert Woodcock).

21 july 98: creation of the Changes file
